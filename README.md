# Kartographer: MKW Layout Generation

## Project Overview

This project aims to study the creative and gameplay-driven design choices behind Mario Kart Wii track layouts. By analyzing community-created tracks and how players actually drive them, we aim to extract design-relevant signals like enjoyment, challenge, creativity, and balance — in a way that can both help human designers reason about a layout and eventually support controlled generation of new tracks that target specific gameplay qualities.

This repository contain the code for:

- **Kartographer:** a generative world model for Mario Kart Wii tracks. Please see [our approach](https://baralll.github.io/Kartographer/kartographer/approach/) for a better understanding of the project. *(in progress)*
- **MKW Telemetry Visualizer** to visualize the data extracted by our [MKW Logger](https://github.com/BARALLL/mkw-logger). Please see [MKW Telemetry Visualizer explained](https://baralll.github.io/Kartographer/mkwdashboard/mkw_dashboard/).
- Data processing tools
